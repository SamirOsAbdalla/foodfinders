## About
Oftentimes we have trouble picking a place to eat; whether with being out with friends or 
simply choosing what to have for dinner, sometimes trying to pick a restaurant can seem 
impossible. Choose no more, for SpeedEats has arrived to choose for you.
<br/>
SpeedEats pulls from both the Yelp and TripAdvisor API to not only provide the best of 
both APIs, but to avoid too much load on any one of them.

## Usage
SpeedEats is very easy to use, all you need to do is click the big blue button on the main page
when the site is initially loaded. From there, assuming you opted to share your location, a 
restaurant will appear based off of any filters you set as well as your current location.

## Features
SpeedEats has a few features to make your restaurant browsing experience much smoother:
- A restaurant history so that you can go back and view any previous restaurants you have seen
- A favorites button to save the restaurants that you deem worthy
- Filters so that even if you feel indecisive, you still have control over what you eat
